    <h1 id="this-is-the-final-motherfucking-website">This is the <em>final</em> motherfucking website.</h1>

<p>And it's <em>really</em> more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

<h2 id="seriously-some-minimal-fucking-things-are-needed-to-make-this-shit-perfect">Seriously, some minimal fucking things are needed to make this shit perfect.</h2>

<p><strong>Ten fucking declarations, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@media</code> block, and one attribute.</strong></p>

<p>That's how much CSS and HTML it took to turn that <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this finally perfect masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shit's <em>finally</em> lightweight and loads fast;</li>
  <li><em>Finally</em> fits on all your shitty screens;</li>
  <li><em>Finally</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers;</li>
  <li><em>Won't</em> bleach your fucking eyeballs at night if your browser thinks you like dark things;</li>
  <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site;</li>
  <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="and-guess-what-motherfucker">And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve reliability on your site. Here's how.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-more-accessibility">A little more accessibility</h2>

<p>I know you love marginalization, but you should take care of people.
The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag doesn't include the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lang</code> attribute</a> in your shitty webpage.<br>
You ever listen to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP94u7y_KkQ">wrong language screen reader lecture</a>? What a shitty experience.</p>

<h2 id="typography-matters">Typography matters</h2>

<p><a href="https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/">Don't be dumb with typography</a>. Don't let improper marks and quotes make their way onto websites because of dumb defaults in applications and CMSs.<br>
And did you let the browser choose the font? Don't make me read such text with <em>Times New Roman</em>.</p>

<h2 id="license-motherfucker">License, motherfucker</h2>

<p>Do you revendicate intellectual property? No. So you must <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choose a fucking public license</a>.<br>
And as you'll never be perfect, let others <a href="https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite">improve your shit</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite/blob/main/LICENSE">do what the fuck they want to</a>.</p>

<h2 id="yes-this-is-the-last-fucking-satire-you-fuck">Yes, this is the last fucking satire, you fuck</h2>

<p>I'm impressed about what the creator of <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration did</a>. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default—they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
